## 📖 Introduction

This project is a web-based clinical decision-support tool designed to automate the facial recognition and severity classification of **Unilateral Cleft Lip/Nose (UCL/N) Deformities**.

The system utilizes Deep Learning (HRNet) to detect facial landmarks and calculate objective severity indicators (Alar Facial Symmetry, Nostril Width Ratio, and Columellar Angle), replacing traditional subjective manual measurements.

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Ethics Statement

The dataset used for training this model consists of clinical images collected from **Hospital Universiti Putra Malaysia (HUPM)**.

**Due to strict patient confidentiality agreements and ethical guidelines:**

1.  **Raw Facial Images are NOT Included:** The original dataset containing patient faces has been excluded from this repository to protect patient privacy.
2.  **Visual Test Results are Excluded:** Generated images with plotted landmarks on patient faces are also excluded.
3.  **Available Data:** Only **anonymized annotation data** (CSV/JSON coordinates), **evaluation metrics**, and **pre-trained model weights** are provided. These allow researchers to verify the data structure and reproduce the training pipeline using their own datasets.

## 🧠 Methodology & Model Training Pipeline

The system uses two distinct models. Below is the step-by-step pipeline to reproduce the training process.

### Model 1: Front View (Alar Facial Symmetry)
*Base Architecture: HRNet-W18 (Pre-trained on WFLW)*
*Citation: [HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection](https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection)*

<img width="712" height="611" alt="model1_flowchart_NEW drawio (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa3664e-e680-4abc-80da-9b77510ec0b2" />

1.  **Preprocessing:**
    * Run `Original Image Processing - Step 1.py`.
    * *Function:* Renames images based on unique IDs and resizes them to a uniform **512x512** resolution.
2.  **Annotation:**
    * Annotate images using **Label Studio**.
    * Export format: JSON (`project-1.json`).
3.  **Data Conversion:**
    * Run `josn_transfer_set 2.py`.
    * *Function:* Converts Label Studio JSON output to CSV format (`唇裂标注分析结果_512px.csv`).
4.  **Dataset Splitting:**
    * Run `data splitting_step 3.py`.
    * *Function:* Splits data into Train/Val/Test (70:15:15) -> `数据集划分.csv`.
5.  **Training:**
    * Navigate to the `HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection` directory.
    * Ensure the pre-trained weights (`HR18-WFLW.pth`) are placed in the root or specified folder.
    * **Run the training command:**
        ```bash
        python -X utf8 tools/train.py --cfg experiments/cleft_lip/pose_hrnet_w18_cleft.yaml
        ```
    * This process will generate the `best_NVM_cleftlip_model_HRNet.pth` weights.
6.  **Testing (Doctor's Benchmark):**
    * Run `json_to_csv_front_view-step test set.py` and then run `validate_en.py`.
    * *Function:* Specifically processes the "Doctor's Gold Standard" annotations for performance evaluation.

### Model 2: Columellar/Angle View
*Base Architecture: Custom HRNet Training (Trained from scratch)*

<img width="686" height="671" alt="model2_flowchart_NEW drawio (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d15a9322-dce5-4afd-b963-79b233c6d826" />

1.  **Preprocessing:**
    * Run `Original Image Processing - Step 1.py` (Same as Model 1).
2.  **Annotation:**
    * Due to the dataset size, annotations were performed in batches (`anno1`, `anno2`, `anno3` JSON files).
3.  **Data Fusion & Conversion:**
    * Run `josn_transfer_second_model-second step2.py`.
    * *Function:* Merges the three partial JSON files and converts them into a single CSV (`第二模型标注结果_512px.csv`).
4.  **Dataset Splitting:**
    * Run `split_dataset_points-step 3.py`.
5.  **Training:**
    * Run `model-tranning.py`.
    * *Function:* Trains the model and generates `best_model_weight...pth`.
6.  **Testing (Doctor's Benchmark):**
    * Run `json_to_csv_angle_view for testing set.py` and then run `testing set result.py`.
    * *Note:* This script handles the specific geometric properties of the columellar angle view differently from the front view.

## 📏 Severity Grading Standards

To ensure objective assessment, the system calculates severity grades based on specific geometric ratios and angular measurements defined in the clinical study.

The severity classification scheme and geometric calculation formulas implemented in this system are based on the foundational research by **Dr. Pauline** regarding unilateral cleft lip nose anatomical deformities.

**The detailed calculation formulas and classification thresholds are illustrated below:**

<img width="468" height="318" alt="屏幕截图 2025-11-23 020855" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9183ccef-7340-4b22-8755-ac27aa65d10d" />

* **Alar Facial Symmetry (A/B):** Calculated as the ratio of the vertical gap of the alar facial groove (A) to the nasal length (B).
* **Nostril Width Ratio (CC/CN):** Calculated by comparing the cleft nostril width to the non-cleft nostril width.
* **Columellar Angle:** Measured as the deviation of the columellar axis from the vertical midline.

## 🚀 Web Application Usage

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the App (Standard Method)
1.  Navigate to the `application` directory.
2.  Run the main Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5002`.
    * *Note:* `config.py` automatically handles path resolution for both development environments and PyInstaller frozen executables. `setup.py` handles Cython compilation for encryption modules.

## 🛠️ Administrative Tools

Beyond the standard web interface, this project includes dedicated GUI tools for system administration and easy deployment.

### 1. GUI Launcher (`launcher_gui.py`)
A graphical interface designed for non-technical users (e.g., clinicians) to launch the application without using the command line. It performs pre-flight checks on the environment before starting the server.
* **How to run:**
    ```bash
    python launcher_gui.py
    ```

### 2. Database Manager (`gui_db_manager.py`)
A dedicated dashboard for administrators to manage the SQLite database without writing SQL queries.
* **Key Features:**
    * **User Management:** View, edit, and delete user accounts.
    * **Role Assignment:** Toggle roles between `Doctor`, `Patient`, and `Admin`.
    * **Security Control:** Reset passwords and manage access permissions.
* **How to run:**
    ```bash
    python gui_db_manager.py
    ```
* **Default Credentials:** The system initializes with `admin` / `admin`. **Please change this password immediately upon first login.**
